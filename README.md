TASK DESCRIPTION:Here’s a concise yet comprehensive **2-paragraph** version combining all key details:

---

This task involves designing and developing a **multi-page e-learning platform UI** with a focus on **course listings, progress tracking, and video embedding**. The goal is to create an **interactive, responsive interface** that includes a homepage (showcasing featured courses and platform benefits), a course catalog (with search/filter functionality), detailed course pages (with embedded videos, syllabi, and reviews), and a user dashboard (tracking progress, certificates, and recommendations). The design must prioritize **usability and visual appeal**, employing modern UI/UX principles like clean layouts, consistent branding, and accessibility features to ensure seamless navigation across devices. Key technical requirements include **semantic HTML5**, modular CSS (using Flexbox/Grid and variables for theming), and JavaScript for dynamic elements like tab systems, accordions, and progress bars. The interface should also integrate interactive components such as hover effects, responsive video players, and data visualization for learner progress.

To execute this, the project will be structured into **separate HTML/CSS/JS files** for each page, with shared components (e.g., headers/footers) styled consistently. The UI will feature a **neutral color palette** with accent colors for calls-to-action, readable typography, and responsive grids. JavaScript will handle critical functionalities: filtering courses, switching tabs on course pages, expanding/collapsing modules, and updating progress metrics in the dashboard. Embedded videos will use HTML5 `<iframe>` or `<video>` tags, while the dashboard will display progress via charts or bars. The final deliverable must balance aesthetics and functionality—optimized for performance, accessibility, and cross-device compatibility—to create a polished, scalable e-learning experience that engages users and fulfills the core requirements of course discovery, content delivery, and progress tracking.
